KIT (or Keep In Touch) is an Android application where users can set up personal reminders to
contact close family or friends.  Users decide which of their contacts with whom they wish to keep
in touch and choose the frequency at which they want to keep in touch (e.g., "I want to make sure I
call my mother at least once a week").  KIT then keeps tabs on your phone calls, text messages, and 
other forms of contact and reminds the user if they are not hitting their desired frequency of contact.

Just a small project for Android development practice.
